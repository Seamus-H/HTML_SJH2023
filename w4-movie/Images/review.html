            <p class="tab">Seen this movie many times.  I love it, it's so silly and ridiculous that it's great.  Adam Sandler is a talented artist.  His sound tracks to his many movies are exceptionally apt to the scene and the genre of audience.</p>
            
            <br>

            <p class="tab">In my opinion, Adam never fails to entertain me and makes me laugh in any of his movies.  I particularly love his team that he takes with  him.  Stop, relax, grab and beer and fall under the spell of Sandler's movies that take you to a place that many other artists don't take their audience.</p>
            
            <br>

            <p class="tab">My husband and friend dressed and played like Happy for a fund raising day.  The running hits are the best on screen and off.  Congratulations Mr. Sandler for making a great movie that just keeps getting better with age. </p>
