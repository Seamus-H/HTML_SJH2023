            <p class="tab">Seen this movie many times.  I love it, it's so silly and ridiculous that it's great.  Adam Sandler is a talented actor.  His sound tracks to his many movies are exceptionally apt to the scene and the genre of audience.</p>
            
            <br>

            <p class="tab">In my opinion, Adam never fails to entertain me and makes me laugh in any of his movies.  I particularly love his team that he takes with  him.  Stop, relax, and fall under the spell of Sandler's movies that take you to a place that many other artists don't take their audience.</p>
